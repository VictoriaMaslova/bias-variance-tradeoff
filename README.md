# bias-variance-tradeoff
An explanation of the Bias Variance Tradeoff in Machine Learning ->  https://medium.com/@mlvictoriamaslova/bias-variance-trade-off-theory-and-practice-2a19fa73116b

In this article I explained the following points:

1.Importance of Error calculation
2. Errors in Machine Learning
3. Bias and its Effects
4. Variance and its Effect
5. Bias-Variance Trade-off
6. Total Error

You will find two practices in the following files:
1. First method to find bias and variance with polynomial function -> (polynomial-function-for-bias-variance-tradeoff.ipynb)
2. Using sklearn library -> (bias-variance-tradeoff.ipynb)
